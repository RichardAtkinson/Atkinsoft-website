Y8950 MSX-AUDIO Test register $01 (write only)

Bit	Description

7	Reset LFOs - seems to force the LFOs to their initial values (eg.
	maximum amplitude, zero phase deviation)

6	something to do with ADPCM - bit 0 of the status register is
	affected by setting this bit (PCM BSY)

5	No effect? - Waveform select enable in YM3812 OPL2 so seems
	reasonable that this bit wouldn't have been used in OPL

4	No effect?

3	Faster LFOs - increases the frequencies of the LFOs and (maybe)
	the timers (cf. YM2151 test register)

2	Reset phase generators - No phase generator output, but envelope
	generators still work (can hear a transient when they are gated)

1	No effect?

0	Reset envelopes - Envelope generator outputs forced to maximum, so
	all enabled voices sound at maximum
