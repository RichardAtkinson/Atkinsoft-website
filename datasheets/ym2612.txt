Here's the format of the YM2612 test register ($21), as best as I can
tell:

bit 7 - If bit 6 set, select 0=LSB, 1=MSB of serial data
bit 6 - If set, reading status returns serial data LSB or MSB instead of
status flags
bit 5 - If set, only the attack phase and possibly decay occur, there is
no sustain o release. It sounds like each channel was keyed-on rapidly.
When the bit is cleared, the channels resume their original position
within the envelope so this bit doesn't have any lasting change on
them.       
bit 4 - Data sent to DAC is inverted - this is *really* loud, so turn
down the volume before using this bit. ;)
bit 3 - Audio output is muted, (the PSG still works of course) bits 4,5
will make sound faintly audible when set in conjunction.
bit 2 - Timer A and B run 24 times faster. 
bits 1,0 - No effect.

Bits 7, 6 allow you to read the serial data sent from the YM2612 to the
DAC. (the other chip, YM3012 - not the DAC at $2A/$2B) I'm unsure of the
exact format, it's probably similar to the YM2151. Bit 4 inverts the
data sent to the DAC, but not the data read from the status register.
Compared to the YM2151 test register documented in MAME, the last 3 bits
may have something to do with the LFO. And I'm also not entirely sure
about the MSB/LSB order for bit 6. Other than that the two work in a
mostly identical way.
