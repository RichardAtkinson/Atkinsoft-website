		<h2>New England Digital Synclavier II</h2>
		<p class="description">In 2011 I acquired a New England Digital Synclavier II. This is a digital synthesizer and sequencer, one of the first workstations before that term was even invented. It uses a combination of additive synthesis and FM synthesis (under licence from Yamaha) and the synthesizer and sequencer part occupy a large rack unit. Some of the Synclavier II's sounds are very distinctive and have not been copied by later instruments because, so far, no instrument has replicated the precise combination of additive synthesis and FM synthesis.</p>
